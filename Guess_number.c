// A and B are playing a guessing game where B first thinks up an integer X (positive,
// negative or zero, and could be of arbitrarily large magnitude) and A tries to guess it. In
// response to A’s guess, B gives exactly one of the following three replies:
// a) Try a bigger number
// b) Try a smaller number or
// c) You got it.
// Write a program by designing an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of guesses
// A has to make. An example (not necessarily an efficient one) below:
// Let B thinks up the number 35
// A’s guess B’s response
// 10 Try a bigger number
// 20 Try a bigger number
// 30 Try a bigger number
// 40 Try a smaller number
// 35 You got it
